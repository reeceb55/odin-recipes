        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love this recipe because it's taken me so long to actually get a good tasting noodle and not just a good tasting piece of cheese on top. This recipe was just trial and error and it's really really good in my opinion.</p>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened - divided</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Sprinkle macaroni with 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir 1/2 cup butter into the pasta.</li>
            <li>Mix 1/4 cup butter, sour cream, cream cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, and egg yolk together in a bowl. Stir flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper, and milk into the sour cream mixture.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/4 cup sour cream sauce over bottom of prepared baking dish. Stir remaining sour cream sauce into macaroni. Pour macaroni into baking dish atop sauce layer; sprinkle mild Cheddar cheese over the casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese topping has melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
